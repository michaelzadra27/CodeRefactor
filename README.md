# <Code Refactor Project>
## This website's code was optimized for readability and accessibility.

- Motivation for this project was to learn some code refactoring. It solves some accessibilty issues with the previous code along with restructuring the HTML elements to make sense with semantic elements. Div tags were replaces with more proper semantic elements along with the CSS being altered for to accomodate changes in HTML and optimize readability. This was all needed to be done without altering the visuals of the page.
